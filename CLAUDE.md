# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a documentation-only repository that teaches users about Claude Code. It contains Markdown files with guides, reference documentation, and workflow examples—no executable code.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` - Sequential learning guides (01-08) covering installation through advanced features
- `examples/` - Practical workflow demonstrations (debugging, features, refactoring, code review, CLI automation)
- `README.md` - Entry point with overview and navigation

## Working With This Repository

When editing documentation:
- Maintain consistency with existing Markdown formatting and table styles
- Keep code examples practical and copy-pasteable
- Cross-reference related docs using relative links (e.g., `[Configuration](./04-configuration.md)`)
- Number files sequentially within directories to preserve reading order
